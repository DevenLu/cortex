## API Gateway

APIs are deployed with an internet-facing API Gateway by default (the API Gateway forwards requests to the API load balancer). Each API can be independently configured to not create the API Gateway endpoint by setting `api_gateway: none` in the `networking` field of the [api configuration](api-configuration.md). If the API Gateway endpoint is not created, your API can still be accessed via the API load balancer; `cortex get API_NAME` will show the load balancer endpoint if API Gateway is disabled.

If you'd like to force traffic to go through your public API Gateway endpoint, set `api_load_balancer_scheme: internal` in your [cluster configuration](../cluster-management/config.md) file before creating your cluster.

If you'd like to ensure that an API is not publicly accessible, set `api_load_balancer_scheme: internal` in your [cluster configuration](../cluster-management/config.md) file, and set `api_gateway: none` in the `networking` field of your [api configuration](api-configuration.md). If you do this, you will need to configure [VPC Peering](../guides/vpc-peering.md) to make prediction requests to your APIs.
